### 1. What is a Tree?

A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes or vertices, where each node has:

*   A **value** (data) stored in it.
*   Zero or more **children** (sub-nodes).

The topmost node is called the **root**.

---

### 2. Types of Trees

1.  **Binary Tree**: Each node can have at most two children: left child and right child.
2.  **N-ary Tree**: A node can have any number of children.
3.  **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree that maintains balance between height and complexity.
4.  **B-tree**: A multi-level index used in databases to speed up data retrieval.

---

### 3. Properties

*   **Full Binary Tree**: All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
*   **Empty Tree**: No nodes or vertices.
*   **Root Node**: The topmost node of a tree.
*   **Left and Right Child**: Nodes that serve as parents for other nodes.

---

### 4. Operations

*   **Insertion**: Adding new nodes while maintaining the tree's structure.
*   **Deletion**: Removing existing nodes while maintaining the tree's structure.
*   **Traversal**: Visiting each node in a specific order, such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).

---

### 5. Real-Life / Computer Uses

*   **File systems**: Organizing files and folders into a hierarchical structure.
*   **Database indexing**: Improving query efficiency by using B-trees or AVL trees for data storage.
*   **Compiler design**: Representing source code as an abstract syntax tree (AST) to analyze and generate executable code.
*   **Graph algorithms**: Solving problems on network graphs, social networks, or web pages.

### 6. Python Example (Binary Tree)

```python
# Node class
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

# Binary Tree class
class BinaryTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None

    # Insert a node at the end
    def insert(self, value):
        if not self.root:
            self.root = Node(value)
            return
        stack = [self.root]
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            if node.left is None:
                node.left = Node(value)
                break
            else:
                stack.append(node.left)
            if node.right is None:
                node.right = Node(value)
                break
            else:
                stack.append(node.right)

    # Traverse the tree in pre-order (root, left, right)
    def preorder(self):
        self._preorder(self.root)
        print("None")

    def _preorder(self, node):
        if node is not None:
            print(node.value, end=" -> ")
            self._preorder(node.left)
            self._preorder(node.right)

# Example usage
bt = BinaryTree()
bt.insert(1)
bt.insert(2)
bt.insert(3)
bt.insert(4)
bt.insert(5)
bt.preorder()  # Output: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> None
```

Output:

```bash
1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> None
```

### 7. Advantages of Trees

*   **Efficient data storage**: Trees can store a large amount of data in a relatively small amount of memory.
*   **Fast searching and retrieval**: Trees enable fast search, insertion, and deletion operations due to their hierarchical
structure.

---

### 8. Disadvantages of Trees

*   **Complexity**: Tree algorithms can be more complex than array-based algorithms, making them harder to understand and
implement.
*   **Insertion and deletion overhead**: Adding or removing nodes in a tree can lead to an increase in the number of nodes,
potentially affecting performance.

### 9. Comparison with Linked Lists

| Operation | Linked List | Tree |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Insertion | O(n) | O(log n) for binary search trees |
| Deletion | O(n) | O(log n) for binary search trees |
