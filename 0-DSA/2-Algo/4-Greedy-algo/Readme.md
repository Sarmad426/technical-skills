### 🧠 Step 1: Intuition Behind Greedy Algorithms

Imagine you’re traveling and need to **collect as many coins as possible** while moving from town to town.
Each town has some coins, and you can only visit one neighboring town at a time.
If you always pick **the town with the most coins next**, without thinking about the rest of the journey — you’re using a **greedy approach**.

That’s the essence:

> A **Greedy Algorithm** makes the best local choice at each step, hoping that it leads to the globally optimal solution.

Sometimes it works perfectly.
Sometimes it fails — because what’s locally best isn’t globally best.

### 💡 Step 2: Real-World Examples

Let’s go through a few **real-world relatable cases**:

#### 1. **Coin Change Problem (like real currency)**

Suppose you want to make ₹43 using coins of ₹25, ₹10, ₹5, ₹1.
A greedy approach says:

> Always choose the **largest coin** possible first.

So you’d pick:
25 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 43. ✅
This works because our coin system is **canonical** (each coin value divides neatly into larger ones).

But in another currency system (say coins of ₹25, ₹10, ₹4, ₹1), greedy would **fail** for ₹12 — it picks 10+1+1=12 (3 coins) instead of 4+4+4 (3 too, okay) but sometimes for other targets, it’s worse.

So greedy works only when the **local optimum → global optimum** relationship holds.

#### 2. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**

You already mentioned it — and yes, it’s a greedy algorithm!
It picks the **closest unvisited node** first (local optimal choice) and expands outward.
It works because distances can’t decrease once the shortest path to a node is found — the “greedy choice property” holds.

---

#### 3. **Kruskal’s / Prim’s Algorithms (Minimum Spanning Tree)**

Both pick **the smallest edge** that doesn’t form a cycle — another classic greedy example.
They build an MST by always choosing the next *cheapest valid edge*.

Think of it like building the cheapest road network connecting all cities — one road at a time.

---

#### 4. **Activity Selection Problem (Scheduling)**

Imagine you have multiple meetings and you want to attend as many as possible.
Each meeting has a start and end time.
Greedy solution:

> Always pick the meeting that finishes the earliest and doesn’t overlap with others.

That’s what calendars and scheduling algorithms often use behind the scenes.

### ⚙️ Step 3: Common Properties

A problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm **only if**:

1. **Greedy Choice Property:** Making a local optimum choice leads to a global optimum.
2. **Optimal Substructure:** The problem can be broken into smaller subproblems that are themselves optimal.

### 🧩 Step 4: Example — Activity Selection (code)

Here’s a small Python snippet to illustrate:

```python
def activity_selection(activities):
    # activities = [(start, end)]
    activities.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # sort by finish time
    last_end = 0
    selected = []
    for start, end in activities:
        if start >= last_end:
            selected.append((start, end))
            last_end = end
    return selected

activities = [(1, 3), (2, 5), (4, 6), (6, 8), (5, 7), (8, 9)]
print(activity_selection(activities))
# Output: [(1, 3), (4, 6), (6, 8), (8, 9)]
```

### 🚀 Step 5: Applications of Greedy Algorithms

* **Networking:** Building minimum-cost spanning trees (Kruskal, Prim).
* **Routing:** Dijkstra’s shortest path.
* **Scheduling:** CPU job scheduling, meeting rooms, airline flight allocation.
* **Data Compression:** Huffman encoding (greedy at each merge step).
* **Finance:** Making change, resource allocation problems.
